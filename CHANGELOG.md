# Changelog

User-visible native, compatibility, security, and release changes are recorded
here. Published versions are listed in
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-facetime/releases).

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Trust the current vincentkoc SSH signing key for release tags while retaining existing trusted keys.

- Update CodeQL security analysis to 4.39.1 while retaining the documented macOS 26 Swift tracing exception. Thanks @dependabot! (#71)

- Update the private harness Vite override to 8.3.5 after the two-day dependency cooldown.

- Select patched Node.js versions in the CI harness to reject the disclosed eMudhra incident keys. Thanks @joshavant. (#70)
- Fix native release publication on macOS Bash 3.2 and allow separately signed recovery tags to finish an uncreated release from its unchanged version tag.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-20

**Highlights:** Select the native backend from current host capabilities without changing security settings, honor explicit SIP restrictions, and bound paired-driver downloads.

### Added

- Select the native backend at runtime with `facetime-audio-capture --select-backend`: retain the injected helper where current security policy and actual initialization permit it, otherwise select out-of-process capture without changing system security settings. Both native artifacts remain shipped. Thanks @RomneyDa. (#50)

### Fixed

- Apply the paired-driver installer's download deadlines to local driver builds too, so a stalled source request cannot hang `pnpm build:driver` indefinitely.
- Bound the privileged paired-driver source download to a 30-second connection timeout and 120 seconds total, so a stalled request cannot indefinitely hold the administrator installer open. Thanks @SebTardif. (#55)
- Respect explicit SIP debugging restrictions and reject contradictory status output before attempting manual helper injection.

### Changed

- Update the development harness to pnpm 11.28.6 while retaining the two-day dependency cooldown and supported Node.js versions.
- Publish native releases only from signed annotated tags after exact-commit push CI succeeds, with signed and notarized dry runs available before publication.
- Update the private test harness to Vitest 5.0.5 while preserving the two-day dependency cooldown and supported Node.js versions.
- Move native CI and release verification to Xcode 27 runners while preserving the macOS 14.4 capture target and Mac Catalyst targets; retain macOS 26 for Swift CodeQL tracing.
- Update the private test harness's Vite override to 8.3.4 while retaining the two-day dependency cooldown and supported Node.js versions.
- Refresh the private test harness dependencies and pnpm to 11.28.5 while retaining the two-day dependency cooldown and supported Node.js versions.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-09-22

**Highlights:** Harden helper JSON validation, preserve outbound-call reconciliation, and prevent stuck injection and duplicate polling.

### Fixed

- Reject non-string `callUUID` values on authenticated call-control actions before asking TelephonyUtilities for a call, so JSON null cannot crash FaceTime. Handshake and envelope string fields are class-checked the same way before `isEqualToString:`. Thanks @SebTardif. (#43)
- Return an ambiguous transaction error with the retained carrier identity when outbound acknowledgement raises, so the Gateway can reconcile a live muted call. Thanks @SebTardif. (#46)
- Transfer FaceTime polling and call-status observer ownership across helper reinjection, using a process-wide key and idempotent initialization. Restart the call app once when upgrading an already injected older helper. Thanks @SebTardif. (#47)
- Bound the injector wait by terminating an LLDB process that ignores SIGTERM after the attach deadline. Thanks @SebTardif. (#44)
- Reply with a transaction error when an authenticated helper action is unknown, instead of leaving the plugin waiting. Thanks @SebTardif. (#45)

## 0.1.2 - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Retain and report outbound carrier identities when native safety checks fail after dialing, so the Gateway can reconcile or cancel a call that may still be active. (#35)
- Retain audio suppression through stdin/stdout loss until captured and successor carriers are confirmed stopped; retry uncertain settlement and preserve explicit safe-close behavior. Thanks @SebTardif. (#32)
- Bind capture shutdown signals to the captured process generation so PID reuse cannot target another process, and let queued safe-close commands take precedence over stdout failure. (#32)
- Keep outgoing-call lookup from muting, disconnecting, or adopting a non-FaceTime call while preserving owned-carrier reconciliation and explicit cancellation. Thanks @SebTardif. (#31)
- Reject malformed `set-muted` values before changing call audio; only JSON booleans may mute or unmute a call. Thanks @SebTardif. (#30)
- Keep FaceTime capture alive during bounded audio backpressure by replacing stale pending frames instead of treating ordinary queue saturation as a fatal conversion failure. Thanks @omarshahine. (#26)
- Distinguish unknown or failed SIP status checks from enabled debugging restrictions before helper injection. Unknown status now asks for manual verification instead of recommending a security-policy change. Thanks @omarshahine. (#34)
- Dispatch the Homebrew updater with the tap-owned FaceTime profile alone, without the conflicting artifact override that prevented formula updates. Thanks @vincentkoc. (#25)
- Bind release signing and verification to the validated commit, and recheck the frozen annotated tag before release writes, publication, and handoff. Same-named branches and moved tags cannot substitute release source. Thanks @vincentkoc. (#24)

### Added

- A current-version Homebrew retry workflow for recovering a failed tap handoff after native release publication, without rebuilding or republishing assets. Release and recovery share the same tap-profile readiness checks. Thanks @vincentkoc. (#25)

### Changed

- Document the available signed native release and Homebrew installation.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- Preserve the notarized `FaceTimeHelper.dylib` bytes and OpenClaw Foundation Developer ID signature when Homebrew relocates installed Mach-O files. `v0.1.0` remains immutable and must not be dispatched to the tap.

### Added

- Repository ownership, contribution templates, private security reporting
  guidance, editor defaults, and dependency update automation.
- CodeQL analysis for Swift capture code, the TypeScript test harness, the
  Homebrew Ruby formula, and GitHub Actions workflows.
- Workflow linting and complete shell-script syntax checks in CI.

### Changed

- Upgrade the private development harness to Vitest 5. Repository development
  now requires Node.js 22.22.3+ within Node 22, 24.15.0+ within Node 24, or 26+;
  Node 25 users must upgrade to a supported version. Native binaries and the
  canonical OpenClaw plugin's runtime requirements are unchanged.
- Clarify first-release availability and the native/plugin ownership boundary.
- Keep the standard MIT license text separate from third-party notices.
