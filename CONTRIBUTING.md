# Contributing

This repository owns the privileged native FaceTime components and their
release pipeline. The TypeScript plugin and its product behavior live in
`openclaw/openclaw`. Send plugin configuration, tool, skill, realtime-provider,
and runtime-lifecycle changes there.

## Development setup

You need an Apple Silicon Mac, full Xcode, a supported Node.js version from
`package.json`, and pnpm 11.24.0 through Corepack.

The Vitest 5 development harness supports Node.js 22.22.3+ within Node 22,
24.15.0+ within Node 24, and 26+. Node 25 is no longer supported for repository
development. Use Node 26 when moving from Node 25. This tooling requirement
does not change the native binaries or the canonical OpenClaw plugin's runtime
requirements.

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Validation

Run the checks that cover your change. Before opening a pull request, run:

```sh
pnpm test
for script in scripts/*.sh; do bash -n "$script"; done
bash scripts/test-native.sh
pnpm build:capture
pnpm build:helper:macabi
make native-archive
make native-verify
```

For workflow changes, also run `actionlint`. GitHub CI runs workflow validation
and the native build/archive checks. It also installs with strict engine
checking and runs the harness on each supported Node.js minimum.
CodeQL covers Swift, TypeScript, Ruby, and Actions; it does not analyze
Objective-C. Native source review and helper
authentication tests remain required when that boundary changes.

Release archives are signed and notarized separately. Follow
`docs/RELEASING.md`; local archives are ad-hoc signed and must never be
published as release assets.

Changes that affect the end-to-end FaceTime product also need the live proof
defined by the canonical
[FaceTime plugin documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/plugins/facetime).

## Pull requests

- Explain the native failure, capability, or release invariant.
- Use a semantic title such as `fix(native):` or `chore(ci):`.
- Include automated proof and any required live proof.
- Document new security or compatibility requirements.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible, compatibility, security, or release
  changes. Pure test and mechanical refactoring changes need no entry.
- Coordinate changes to `helper-endpoint.json` or `native-protocol.env` with
  the canonical plugin.
- Never commit credentials, generated native binaries, or generated
  `OpenClawBridge.driver` artifacts.
- Keep call details and private paths out of reports. Use [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
  for vulnerabilities.

Maintainers review changes through pull requests and use squash merges after
the required checks and review pass. Repository ownership is recorded in
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS).

Repository-owned source is MIT licensed. Incorporated and adapted helper source
retains the terms in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. The locally generated audio
driver is a separate modified GPL-3.0 artifact and stays outside release
archives.
